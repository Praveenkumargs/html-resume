                <h3>AYUR SOFT APP (using React Native):</h3>
                <p>
                    Created Ayur Soft, a React Native mobile app that analyzes patient symptoms to
                    recommend suitable Ayurvedic drugs and formulations, while also suggesting doctor
                    consultation for further guidance. The app combines traditional healthcare knowledge with
                    modern technology, offering an accessible, reliable, and user-friendly platform for health
                    support.

            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS OF A VEHICLE (using React Native):</h3>
                <p>
                    Developed a React Native mobile application for performance evaluation and analysis of
                    motorcycles, allowing users to check pricing, compare specifications, and filter vehicles
                    based on their requirements. The app categorizes motorcycles by type (sports, cruiser,
                    commuter, adventure, off-road) and provides side-by-side comparisons of parameters such as
                    engine capacity, mileage, power, torque, and price, enabling users to make data-driven
                    decisions when selecting a vehicle.

                <h3>MOBILE CHARGING USING COIN INSERTION (using Arduino):</h3>
                <p>
                    Completed a mini project on a coin-operated mobile charging station using Arduino.
                    Designed and programmed the system to initiate charging upon coin insertion. Ensured safe and
                    reliable operation through effective circuit design. Successfully demonstrated the project as a
                    functional prototype.

                <h3>AUTOMATIC DRIP IRRIGATION (using Raspberry Pi):</h3>
                <p>
                    Completed a project on automatic drip irrigation using a Raspberry Pi board. Developed
                    and programmed a system to monitor soil moisture and control water flow. Integrated sensors
                    and designed the circuit for efficient water management. Successfully demonstrated the project
                    as a practical solution for smart irrigation.

                    HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM (using ESP32):
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Developed a health monitoring system using ESP32 and sensors to track vital signs and
                    send data to the cloud. Programmed the ESP32 to ensure real-time monitoring with seamless
                    cloud integration. Enabled access to health data from any device via a cloud application.
                    Successfully implemented the system, offering a scalable solution for remote health tracking.
